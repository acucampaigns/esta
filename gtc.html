	    <p style="
    line-height: auto;
">
By using our website, you are automatically agreeing to the Terms and Conditions as defined below.<br />
Please read the following carefully before continuing to use our website.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">1) Legal Definitions</h4><br />
For clarity, the following phrases and words are defined as shown below when used in the context of our<br />
Terms and Conditions:<br />
&bull; Any reference to &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;company&quot; refers to our company and its subsidiaries<br />
&bull; The terms &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;yourself&quot; and &quot;user&quot; refer to any individual user visiting this website<br />
&bull; &quot;This site&quot;, &quot;site&quot;, and &quot;website&quot; refer to www.dhsgov-esta.us<br />
&bull; The phrases &quot;service&quot; or &quot;services&quot; refer to the ESTA or E-Visa application processing services we provide<br />
&bull; &quot;Your information&quot;, &quot;user information&quot;, &quot;personal information&quot; and &quot;client information&quot; all refer to any data<br />
about you, or those people you represent, that you provide to us for the express purpose of using our<br />

&bull; The phrase &quot;working day&quot; means a day during the week when banks are open for regular business<br />
&bull; &quot;Terms&quot; refers to this site's Terms and Conditions<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">2) What We Offer</h4><br />
We offer to process and review electronic travel authorization applications for travel to the USA. Please<br />
note that our company and website (dhsgov-esta.us) are privately owned and operated. They are not<br />
connected with any government department, agency or bureau. During your online application process<br />
you may see notes regarding further information about the travel authorization you are applying for.<br />
When you click on the associated button you are understood to be entering into an agreement with our<br />
company.
<br />

All visitors to our website have the option of lodging their own applications directly on the official<br />
government portal without our assistance. The application cost for a USA travel authorization is<br />
currently US $ 14.00 charged directly by the USA government. We will though not be able to assist with<br />
applications that we have not reviewed and processed.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">3) Payment for our Products and Services</h4><br />
There is no charge to access our website, view our products/services or ask questions. However, we do<br />
charge for verifying, processing and/or reviewing applications. Before you start an ESTA application we<br />
will clearly tell you what the cost of our service will be. All individual ESTA applications processed are<br />
charged at USD $ 86.00 each, which includes tax and the US government mandatory fee of US $ 14.00.<br />
There are no other fees charged. By completing the steps and clicking on the pay button, you are<br />
agreeing to the fee charged by our company.<br /><br />
Payment can only be made by credit card; all major brands are accepted. The cost of the service or<br />
product will be charged in U.S. dollars ($).<br />
If you use a credit card in a currency other than U.S. dollars, your credit card provider will convert the<br />
price in U.S. dollar into your local currency using their own exchange rate. The charge will show on your<br />
statement after 4-8 days. The transaction may also incur additional fees or card-use charges levied by<br />
your credit card provider. We have no influence over such additional fees.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">4) ESTA Application Processing</h4><br />
It is your sole responsibility to find out whether a visa is required for you to visit another country before<br />
you travel. Depending upon your nationality and personal history, you may be eligible to apply for an<br />
ESTA (Electronic System Travel Authorization) when traveling to the USA. To obtain an ESTA you must<br />
provide certain details about yourself, your passport and your reason for visiting the country.<br />
Our website services provide online application forms with all the questions you will need to answer in<br />
order to submit an application for ESTA. Part of our specialized service is to review the answers you<br />
provide, along with your information, before we process and submit the application on your behalf. If we</p>

<p style="
    line-height: auto;
">need any additional information or see anything that may jeopardize your application, we will contact<br />
you by email. Please note that any verification of information will delay the processing period.<br />
Once we have ascertained that the information you have provided is valid and complete, we submit your<br />
application to the US government department for approval. If for any reason your application cannot be<br />
submitted for processing, we will inform you and refund your payment in full.<br />
To receive a response to your ESTA application can take up to 72 hours. However, we advise all<br />
travellers to begin the ESTA application process as soon as possible, and at least 7 days before your<br />
departure in order to allow time for any unforeseen delays or problems.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">5) What Happens if your E-visa or ESTA Application is Denied</h4><br />
If for any reason we are unable to process your application, you can submit another application using a<br />
different service provider. Alternatively, you can go directly to the relevant government website and<br />
submit an application yourself. The final decision to approve or reject any ESTA or E-visa application lies<br />
entirely with each government. If your application is denied, we recommend that you get in touch with<br />
the embassy or consulate representing the country you wish to visit and they will advise you of the best<br />
way to apply for a standard visa instead. This can take longer than a regular E-visa, so time should be<br />
allowed for this possible delay.<br />
In exceptional circumstances, a government may choose to withdraw approval for an Electronic Travel<br />
Authorization (E-visa or ESTA) even after it has been approved. In certain situations, they are authorized<br />
to change the status from 'Approved' to 'Not authorized to visit with an E-visa'. Even if your application is<br />
approved, it is only an authorization to travel. It does not guarantee entry into the country you are<br />
intending to visit. The final decision lies with the Customs and Immigration Officer when you arrive at<br />
the port of entry. We cannot take any responsibility for any losses incurred if a decision is made to<br />
decline or withdraw approval for you to enter a country. We cannot be held liable for any costs or claims<br />
resulting from such a decision.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">6) Your Responsibilities</h4><br />
It is the sole responsibility of any traveller to comply with all requirements regarding their visit to a</p>

<p style="
    line-height: auto;
">foreign country. You are required to answer all questions honestly and fully when making your ESTA or E-<br />
visa application. If any information is incorrect, you may not be allowed to board a flight or boat, or you</p>

<p style="
    line-height: auto;
">may be refused entry to your intended destination country. In this instance our company cannot be held<br />
liable for any subsequent costs or inconveniences.<br />
<h4 style="
    color: rgba(1, 60, 115, 0.49);
    line-height: 0px;
    padding-top: 21px;
">7) Our Contract</h4><br />
All orders made on our website consist of three mandatory pages with questions and payment<br />
information that must be completed by all customers. These actions can only be made by the customer<br />
who submits the order him/herself. We accept the offer to process the travel authorization once the<br />
complete application and payment are submitted. The order is accepted by us once we dispatch the<br />
email with the approved travel authorization. Purchasing our processing service indicates that the Terms<br />
and Conditions are accepted. This contract can be concluded in English or the language selected when<br />
completing the order.<br />
